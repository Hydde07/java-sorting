# Sorting Project

This project contains implementations of different sorting algorithms. It is structured to be easily built and executed within a Java development environment, specifically configured to work with the NetBeans IDE.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following main folders and files:

- `src`: Contains the source code of the project, organized into subfolders representing different modules or functionalities, such as binary file manipulation (`arquivoBin`), doubly linked lists (`listaDE`), and the main module (`trabpo`).

- `build` and `nbproject`: Folders that contain configuration files for building and managing the project in NetBeans, including property and XML files for specific settings.

- `.dale` files: Files with data that can be sorted, randomized, or reverse-sorted.

- `build.xml` and `manifest.mf`: XML and manifest files that assist in building the project, specifying how the project should be compiled and executed.

- `output.txt`: A file that contains output from the project execution.

## How to Build

To build the project, you will need the NetBeans IDE and the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. Open the project in NetBeans through the root folder and use the IDE's build tools to compile the project.

## How to Run

After building, the project can be executed directly through NetBeans. Select the main module and run it through the IDE. The execution process may vary depending on the specific module you want to run.
